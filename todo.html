It is also considered to be the most important nesting place of sea birds in all of the Mexican Caribbean. </p>
  <p id="isla2">The island holds more than a hundred and fifty migrating and resident bird species. The most numerous being the frigate, brown pelican and double-crested cormorant. It is also an essential nesting spot for Sea Turtles. Not only are the species of birds beautiful but the beach is sandy white and it is secluded.
